Tov is a programming language with a frontend inspired by Haskell and a backend inspired by tinygrad. It's meant to let you write AI/ML programs in a beautiful and intuitive functional language while having an easy-to-understand backend that can easily be adapted to new hardware and runs blazingly fast.

Currently in kind of development to help me better understand tinygrad. Eventually I might rewrite the whole thing and actually turn it into something.
